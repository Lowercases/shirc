shirc is a bash "library" for IRC support.

Its purpose is to provide access to IRC servers for shell scripts, making it
possible to create ircbots (or irc clients, if you will) using the unix shell as
programming platform.

For connection, it abuses redirection, FIFOs, and shell job handling in an
unpleasant and awkward, yet pretty much standard way. It uses nc(1) for the net
communication (bash-specific /dev/tcp was intentionally avoided), the grep(1)
family for string handling, and tries to pollute only the shirc_* namespace in
bash.

Please take a look at src/shircbot.in for basic usage sample. Documentation is
on the way.
